- Research Subject: Stripe
    - Founder story: Who are the founders? What are their past experiences?
        - 小時候環境薰陶一直是很多創辦人共同點 ：
            - 受電子工程訓練的父親跟微生物學家的母親對 Patrick 和 John 的影響很大，除了日常的教育以外(餐桌談話內容就超過學校所學)，而且在他們是青少年時期家裡就有 9 台電腦，每個月的衛星頻寬費用要 100 歐元
            - Patrick 出生時，他媽媽就辭職在家經營小型顧問公司 ( ISO 申請之類的 )，父親在 Patrick 5歲左右買下一家旅館(規模不確定，但猜想應該不會太大)，做生意對兩兄弟應該是很習慣、自然的事情
            - 展現對 Coding 熱情:  看到互聯網的書籍就對其產生熱情，13 歲接觸到程式語言時，就完全的投入( 放棄 JAVA 是個小插曲)，讓他 15/16歲連兩年參加當地知名的 Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition ，專案題目是圖靈測試相關(應該可以說跟 AI 相關)，以及 Croma 語言開發( LISP 語言的更新 )
            - Patrick 16 歲贏得 Young Scientist Exhibition 的那年，在家自學的他用 20 年的時間完成 2年制的高中考試(30個測試)，並且童年用他 13 歲時 SAT 的成績申請上 MIT，完成這些後他才實行他的 Transition Year，在申請 MIT 之前 Patrick 就參加過美國史丹福大學的 LISP 大會，留下了深刻印象
            - 弟弟 John 也很優秀，用8次  A1s/ 2次A2s 成績(應該很厲害)畢業，但 John 是選擇第二年為 Transition Year，第三年才回來完成學業
            - Note: 愛爾蘭國中教育以取得中考畢業證書（Junior Certificate）作為結束。國中教育結束後，學生可以選擇2年的高中畢業會考課程學習;也可以選擇1年的過渡年（Transition Year）教育，然後再進入2年的高中會考課程學習，愛爾蘭中學過渡學年課程與實踐是 由學校根據教育科學部的規定來設計和安排的；所以也不一定要從高一讀起,可以直接從高二開始就學，大部分學生都能順利通過過渡年的學習，但如果一個學生沒有做指定的作業或者是缺席了大量的時間，學校也有可能會要求他們離開
        - 初創事業:
            - 2007年，在上述提到的 Transition Year， 17歲的 Patrick和 15歲的 John 開始他們的創業初體驗，他們瞄準的是透過更好的工具加強 eBay 的用戶體驗( 庫存、流量追蹤...等軟體服務 )，因為他們覺得 eBay 當時更新速度實在太慢了，開發期間他們申請了 Y Combinator，而 Paul Graham 建議他們與英國的2人公司合併，基本上這英國小公司也是想打造更好的 eBay (但瞄準學生市場)
            - 合併後的公司為 Automatic，他們搬到美國西岸工作幾個月後，公司就被 Canadian company Live Current Media 收購($5 million)，Patrick 也變成了這間加拿大公司的工程總監，而 John 回去完成其學業
            - Patrick 自述這段經歷，他覺得這時期他學到了非常多的東西，但也認為 "Automatic never left any huge mark the world"，而這段時間他們應該也體認到線上生意因為支付系統的不完善而受到很大的限制，很多是是銀行間的中間層的沒效率影響
            - 儘管當時已經有 PayPal ( Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Max Levchin founded PayPal in 1998, which was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion )，但可能是獨大因素，讓 PayPal 對初創公司來說非常不友善，例如: 一旦公司達到一定規模，PayPal 就會把你升級，讓你的 30% 營收會被鎖在 PayPal 長達 2個月，但不選擇 PayPal 就要自己處裡非常繁瑣麻煩的中間金流過程 
            - Patrick 後來還是回到了 MIT、 John 完成高中學業後去哈佛，兩個人也有持續保持聯絡，並且在做一些小項目，賣掉公司前後 Patrick 還跟加拿大友人弄了 iPhone 版的 WiKi，以及嘗試依些網路框架
        - 心境轉變:
            - 從 Patrick 近期訪談可以感受到，初創就歷經最長牛市的 Stripe，可以非常專注在產品的技術面，並依靠讓產品變得越來越好而持續成長，跟 spotify 要開始跟音樂產品搏鬥前的情境有點像，就是專注把產品做好就對了("It's very easy to become, excessively, technologists.")，如今 Payment 的競爭加劇、最長低利率時代終結、大環境劇變、Stripe 規模...等因素，讓創辦人漸內心漸漸接受  “Okay fine, we’re businesses, I guess.” 
        - 原則:
            - Micro Pessimism, Macro Optimism: Patrick 在一些宏觀、長時間的願景上是很樂觀的，例如，他認為數位經濟還處於很早期的階段，因為世界上還有太多實體的活動沒有數位化(他舉農場為例)，或是對於現況總是相信 2 年後一定會變更好，而這前提下讓微觀的悲觀帶領著持續改變進步，例如微觀悲觀會讓你對現有產品提出很多的批評，很多覺得不好的疑慮，
            - 這跟 Peter Thiel 在 Zero to one 的觀點很像，其提倡確定性的樂觀才能做大事，因為網路泡沫後的不確定性樂觀讓大家太小鼻子小眼睛，只會做出 140字推文..等產品，不會有太偉大的創新，這也在他早期的訪談中提到他對 Peter Thiel 的讚賞可看出 Patrick 受其影響很大

    - Growth history: Please piece together as much information as possible about the company's growth history, including whether it has ever pivoted, the key growth methods, and whether it has ever suffered any major setbacks.
        - 成長主軸的規劃會抓在
            - 平台支援國家的增加 ( 可接收世界各地付款的區域, 目前 47 個 )，除了開拓新客戶外，能因應原客戶的國際化業務需求也是重點，這會影響客戶黏著度 
            - 因應客戶需求的多元付款管道與方式支援，以及其他延伸的服務
            - 早期讓創業者快速上手的經驗一直在，後續持續關注如何擴大線上 GDP
        - Building infrastructure: 2010-8 - 2011-9 ，產品剛推出時大概 8名員工，產品推出後半年(2012年3月左右) 員工數量約 23人
        - Stripe 的產品2011年9月底推出沒多久就獲得滿多的好評，Techcrun 在2012年7月文章就提到Patrick 受訪說明當時平台有 100K 的開發者帳戶，而好的產品也要有整體大環境的支持才行，以下幾點
            - 2010 - 2015 是 Smart phone 年銷售數量的高成長期，約每年 3 億的銷售量成長到 每年14億
            - 2010 Cyber Monday 美國線上銷售額達 1B，算是 2005 開始以來的里程碑
            - 2010 也是 Social Media 盛行的時期，Facebook(2012上市)、Twitter 當紅、Instagram 崛起，很多好工具很容易傳播
        - 因為使用者增加，Stripe 2012年又募了兩次資金(1.8M + 2.0M)，主要是要進駐舊金山並且招募更多員工來加速成長，此時共享經濟當紅，Uber、Lyft、Airbnb
        - 2013: 主力應該還是北美市場，但其他區域的基礎設施已經在開發中，這時共享經濟正紅，手機的支援應該是很明顯的方向，買下 Kickoff (iPhone 為主的任務管理 App ) 應該還是著眼於接觸更多的客戶或是加強黏著度，應該不是想要推出其他服務增加營收
            - Expand:  Canada 、Beta of its platform in the UK
            - powers online payments for thousands of companies, including Foursquare, Reddit, Shopify and Squarespace.
            - does payroll processing for marketplaces like Exec, Lyft
            - 收購 Kickoff：　[Kickoff](http://kickoffapp.com/), a chat and task-management app for teams
        - 2014 ：這時的採購應該就是為了讓客戶成功的收到世界各地的付款，因為付款國家越多，其整合需求越高（當地都有一些付款App或方式...等)，一個好的整合工具讓客戶容易開拓海外市場是著眼的目標
            - Acquire RunKit (Tonic ): an app development and prototyping service (a tool for prototyping JavaScript) — in a move meant to shore up its developer offering
                - “RunKit is a node playground in your browser,” the company explains, so instead of having to spend hours setting up the right workplace on your computer, you can do everything right in your browser.
            - Expand: United Kingdom and Ireland
            - Visa 策略性投資 Stripe, 因為 Stripe 的產品顯然跟信用卡網絡服務商的連接是很緊密，而 Stripe 用成功，Visa 他們賺的錢就越多（除非像 Paypal 一樣想用其他支付管道），兩者合作是很合理的
        - 2015: 有篇2015年11月的文章提到 Stripe 在2015 年的工作對後續全球化的發展很重要，而 2016 年以後 Stripe 的營收資訊相對好找，數據顯示 2016 年後的確經手的付款金額成長滿驚人的
            - Expand: to 7 additional European countries, including Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.
            - 其他重點：支援ACH and Bitcoin, 這些支援以及國際化是讓 API 越來越複雜的重要因素，導致2017 年下定決心要把整個架構改寫
            - Acquire: Totem: The company mainly offers [marketing tools](https://startuptalky.com/marketing-sales-tools/) for brands on social media platforms, including Instagram
            - 今年他們提到的進展
                - Stripe has struck blockbuster deals to support Apple Pay, the Cupertino, California, tech giant's digital wallet, as well as Google's Android Pay and payment capabilities for other Silicon Valley luminaries including Facebook, Twitter, Lyft, Pinterest, and Salesforce.
                - Big companies including American Express and Sony have also lined up, and it's gotten a strong boost in China by processing a chunk of payments for Alibaba's Alipay.
            - 因應一些競爭的說明，Stripe 認為先行者優勢是明顯的，因為抓緊大公司，就能享受他們的全球化的成長
                - Stripe has something of a first-mover advantage, Peterson says, and its deals with big Silicon Valley companies will give it scale. It has also shown intelligence in the way it's going after a global market for digital payments, which are expected to grow exponentially in the next five years to $6 trillion, Aite estimates.
                - competitors: Amazon and PayPal, and other startups like Square, Braintree, and Litle (the latter two are now owned by PayPal and Vantiv, respectively)
        - 2016 : 
            - Processed Payment Volume:  20B、   Gross: 450M、   Revenue： 95M
            - launches in Japan
        - 2017： 今年開始 Stripe 變得非常積極投資私人公司，從 Monzo 開始，到現在已經投資約 33 家私人企業[(Stripe investments)](https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/stripe-investments/a2061916-9ade-4627-aed5-70606b411cd5/funding_rounds), 整體來說 Stripe 投資主要是為了整合各地支付系統的目的 EX: Rapyd (UK), PayMongo (Philippines), Paystack (Nigeria, which it acquired), Balance (Israel) and Safepay (Pakistan)，以及支付延伸的相關的功能（稅務/ 薪資/支票...等）
            - Processed Payment Volume:  50B、   Gross: 1B、   Revenue： 200M
            - Expand : 4 additional European countries, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland
            - 今年比較大的內部事情是重新架構支付API，並於 2018 推出，也有可能是這樣的過程讓 Stripe 於2018年宣佈放棄比特幣的兌換和支付
            - Acquire: Payable is a platform that helps contractors to get their payments hassle-free.  Payable built a deep integration with the Stripe API that automated generating and sending the right tax forms to the right people for thousands of Stripe platforms.
            - Acquire: Indie Hackers:  community and website where well-known entrepreneurs and founders of profitable businesses share their stories on the platform
            - Investment Monzo: digital-only bank platform and marketplace that allows customers to access a range of products and services.  
        - 2018: 業績一樣蒸蒸日上，持續投資與擴張，年處理的支付金額成長一倍, 但18/19年毛利/營利下降，很有可能是開始擴大規模投資 Service Hub, 這也是這一年的幕資主因, 令一個比較令人注目的 Index 收購案，因為這算是正式要進軍實體店面付款的大動作, 這可能也是當時 Omni-channel 當道，如果不擴實體店面的化，對很多客戶來說會是某個拼圖拼不起來
            - Processed Payment Volume:  100B、   Gross: 1.5B、   Revenue： 310M
            - Expand: Australia and New Zealand
            - 2018 index: a retail software company that provides security, personalised experiences and others. It mainly helps retailers to evolve their in-store payments and create their customer contact database.Index is known for PIN pads that help read a chip card in just a second. The headquarters of the company is situated in San Francisco, United States of America.
            - 大事件： 宣佈放棄 Bitcoin 的支援，因為加密貨幣在遇到 22 年逆風前一直是持續被看好的領域，放棄 Bigcoin 對於 Stripe 這樣的領先者來說應該是個滿重大的挫敗，這感覺也很像當時很多人想導入 AI，但發現要很有效的應用 AI 好像不是這麼容易一樣
        - 2019: 
            - Processed Payment Volume:  150B、   Gross: 2B、   Revenue： 415M
            - Expand: 8 additional European countries, including Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Greece.

        - “We wanted it to be extremely simple to integrate. You should be able to start charging credit cards immediately. There shouldn’t be any latency. You shouldn’t have to talk to anybody. The information you have to give shouldn’t be pages long… Google Checkout and PayPal are these confusing things, and we wondered why they hadn’t solved these issues.” — Patrick Collison
        - 幾個主要技術上的階段:
            - Supporting card payments in the US (2011-2015)
            - Adding ACH and Bitcoin (2015)
            - Seeking a simpler payments API (2015 - 2017)
        - First launched to the public:  
            - “seven lines of code,” suggesting that’s all it took for a business to power payments on Stripe
            - supports Ruby, PHP, Python, you don’t need a merchant account or gateway and Stripe will handle everything, including with storing cards, subscriptions, and direct payouts to a bank account

        - 早期：推出後約 10 個月，Techcrunch 文章內容提到，一些使用者回饋:
            - Co-founder Patrick Collison tells me that there are presently 100k developer accounts created on the platform, and from what I’m hearing there are also some “major” e-commerce players in the pipeline to use it.
            - “For us the real advantage of Stripe is that it makes payments so easy to implement it changes the types of products we can build,” says [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/) founder Nat Friedman on why he chose the product over competitors, “We’re able to experiment with introducing paid features, marketplaces, and other ideas that we otherwise wouldn’t even try.”
            - “Processing credit card payments ourselves would mean PCI compliance and supporting a host of different credit card types, and dealing directly with the banks that do the clearing,” says Foursquare’s Jason Liszka, who also uses Stripe to process payments on Foursquare, “Stripe’s API abstracts away all these complications and lets us focus on our core business.”
            - Exec’s Justin Khan had a similar hassle-free Stripe experience :
                - Stripe made it super, stupid easy to set up live payments on Exec. It took me like 30 minutes when we were first launching our beta for Exec in January, and I’m not even a good programmer. Here’s the chain of events:
                - 1pm: I think “hmm, we’re going to need to add payments to Exec. Good thing I know the Collisons, so I’ll be able to get a live account faster.”
                - 1:01pm: I realize I can just sign up for an account and immediately start processing payments from the [stripe.com](http://stripe.com/) site, no questions.
                - 1:05pm: I start reading the documentation, add their js file to our beta site.
                - 1:25pm: I have test payments working. They show up in real time.

        - 產品最重要主軸 - 極容易使用+高度客製化彈性+增加黏著度功能: 
            - 極容易導入：產品開發大方向跟 Amazon 很類似，就是以顧客為核心長期去更新迭帶產品，而 Stripe 從早期開始就是以開發者為核心，讓客戶極度容易導入，這從其早期客戶都是從 Github、Stack Exchange 來的，而極容易使用的結果也會讓銷售成本大幅降低，因為不太需要太多的推廣、解說、協助...等
            - 彈性：夠簡潔好用的 API, 表示很容易客製化，因應持續演進的線上商業活動，都能夠有對應的客製工具（EX: 訂閱這種不同等級，不同週期的付款）
            - 以上大原則讓 Stripe 有著先行者優勢，也就是讓客戶比較容易先嘗試 Stripe，而且透過各種服務配套來增加其黏著度, 某些功能是具有網絡效應的，像是偵測/防止詐欺，其客戶越多，他們防詐欺經驗越多，Stripe 所有客戶就越安全，一旦客戶規模擴大，就會有一定程度的轉換障礙，在線上支付產品相對成熟的環境下也許這障礙不會真的很高，但是會讓客戶無法輕易的因為便宜一點的費用就決定換成另外一家
            - 其他增加黏著度功能：Billing是專為訂閱經濟而設計的功能、稅務、薪資、詐欺、發票...等
        - 更多的營收機會：Business lending & corporate cards、Virtual card issuance、加密貨幣
        - 拓展線上經濟：提供各種方便業者拓展生意的支援功能，例如 Stripe Atlas 讓你在美國申請公司變得超簡單
        - 隱憂：
            - 超大規模的客戶如果有心，可能會想把這一段過程的錢省下來而跳下海自己做或是談判手續費，例如 Stripe 2021年的營收中，Shopify 就佔 $350M (Total $1.5B)，當 Shopify 任何要求對 Stripe 影響都很大
            - 競爭：除了 PayPal 外，Adyen 跟 Stripe 的比較是最常見的，因為兩者的策略明顯不同，Adyen 顯然是期望客戶可以提供更多資訊來申請服務帳號，好讓 Adyen 可以做出比較完整的服務
        - 以下是 Stripe 官網提出的 Solutions:

        - 什麼都可以賣的線上世界：
            - 記得幾個月前第一次看到 Dropbox Shop 時我個人印象非常深刻，因為長久以來埋在自己雲端硬碟的東西，突然不需要多做什麼（註冊平台、寫電子書、進入方格子等部落格...等），只要一個連結就可以把自己整理的內容拿去網路到處賣錢了，這讓我對於 Stripe 創辦人兄弟一直在提Internet Economy 更加有感，因為他們產品是更符合這種願景的，讓網路買東西可以像攤販一樣，哪個區域有活動就去擺擺攤，自由度極高，加上這世界對非實體商品付費的接受度越來越高，我想這就是 Stripe 著眼的最佳機會, 也因此他們也常常做出各種支持創業家推廣活動 ( EX: Stripe Press 列出各種可以激發你想法的書籍 )
