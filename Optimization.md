    - Why learn? 
        - I want to finish a new algorithm project.
        - Get into the theory of optimization and improve out team's ability
    - What to do?
        - Breakdown the problem and convert into the optimization form

                - Convex?
                - Discrete Optimization  : some or all of the variables in a model are required to belong to a discrete set
                    - [[Combinatorial Optimization]] : The discrete set is a set of objects, or combinatorial structures, such as assignments, combinations, routes, schedules, or sequences.
                - Uncertainty?
                - Constrained?
