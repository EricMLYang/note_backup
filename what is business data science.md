- [[business data science]]
- Business data science is all about distilling your decision problem into a small number of variables that can be compared in few simple plot.
- Just like a simple model that related individual stock return to the market average (capital asset pricing model)
- An interpretable model translated raw data into information that is directly relevant to decision-making
- You want to project the information in your data into a low-dimemsiinal space that contains key insights for the decision you need to make.
